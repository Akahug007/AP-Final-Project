Hello!

This is game Ive created for my AP Computer Science A Final!
It is a console-based game coded on the Java programming language.
The program is similarly based on a real-life game called Casino-War game.
- Though the game is modified in the program
It features fake currency that can be used to play games called War.

- How to play the game:
  In real life:
    - Casino War game starts with a deck of 52 cards shuffled
    - Players simultaneously flip the top card of their deck
    - Whoever gets the highest card value takes both flipped cards
    - If the values are equal, then a "war" occurs
      - In War
        - Players place 1 card face down and 1 card face up
        - Player with the highest face up card collects all cards from the table
        - If face-up cards are still equal another war is declared
    - The game continues until one of the players wins all cards
    - Card Ranking highest to lowest: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
      
  In the program:
    - Similar to real life with modifications such as use of color and change  in decks and sizes
    - User of the program are given prompts to answer
      - Such as:
        - Their name
        - Number of decks
        - Size of each deck
        - Shuffling options
  
  - There is no GUI in this program as most of the action/functionality is taking place within the console
  - The prompts/user inputs are only used on a console.
  - Be warned that user inputs are case sensitive
    - The program is made to have multiple choice questions or true/false questions

- Special Features:
  - One of the special features of the game would be the addition of cheating in the game
  This is done through having the cheater be able to have the highest value cards in the
  their entire deck.
  
  - For programmers:
    - Another special feature would be the use of exception handling, this allows the program
  to run correctly and in alternative methods if the user inputs an unacceptable answer
  or if the functionality is not performing as expected.
    - Lastly, the program also features interfaces which allowed for classes to require 
    certain methods and variables.
